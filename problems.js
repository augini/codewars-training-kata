    1: ` Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

        For example:
        
        uniqueInOrder('AAAABBBCCDAABBB') == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']
        uniqueInOrder('ABBCcAD')         == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'c', 'A', 'D']
        uniqueInOrder([1,2,2,3,3])       == [1,2,3]`,

    2: `Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

  If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA
  
  In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

      If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.
